        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Ham Loaf Superb is just as the name of the dish, simply superb! This delicious dish is a perfect main dish for any kind of occasion, formal or informal. I Try this Ham Loaf Superb recipe!</p>
        
        <p>The ham loaf is a mixture of ground round and ground ham.  There was a time when you could ask the butcher to grind a ham steak together with the ground round, but not anymore.  For some reason, most supermarkets will not do this.  I either grind my own ham in my Kitchen Aid with the meat grinder attachment or buy a tube of ground ham.  I just discovered this product.  You may find that small supermarkets will be more willing to grind a piece of ham.  However you arrive at the mixture, you will not be disappointed.</p>
        
        <p>On anther note, one of the things I try to do during the holidays is to support local businesses.  The big box stores are not in danger of losing customers, but by supporting small businesses we can make a big difference.</p>
