# odin_recipes
My first project on The Odin Project:  a simple recipes website

This Recipes Project will help you practice the HTML knowledge you have aquired
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
It won't be pretty, but we will revisit it in the future to style it up with CSS.
